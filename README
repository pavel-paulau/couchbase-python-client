pylibcb

for now, the home of the first iteration of a python library wrapping
libcouchbase functionality

before you use this, you'll need to install:

Couchbase 1.8
libevent (libcouchbase is version 1 compat)
use the most recent version of libmemcached from libmemcached.org. build from scratch
https://github.com/couchbase/libvbucket
https://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase

for libcouchbase, when running configure, you should invoke it with --prefix=/opt/couchbase

from my home machine, i had to use the following invocation:

env CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/couchbase/include" ./configure --prefix=/opt/couchbase

for now, there is just an example program @ poc/argh.c which demonstrates
constructing an event loop explicitly to add ones own timeouts (which
are currently not supported for high level libcouchbase operations)
to the event loop
